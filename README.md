# Java Project: Working with Java Streams

This project will help you learn how to use Java 8 Streams in your own projects. 
The main project will analyse a bank transaction feed that we will read tranactions from a text file and produce a simple report summary.
But first, we will start with some simple operations to help you get a feel for working with Streams in Java 8.

## Building the project
The project comes with both Maven and Gradle build scripts. To run the tests in Maven, you can use the following command:
```
$ mvn clean verify
```

To run the tests in Gradle, you can run the following from the project root directory:
```
$ ./gradlew test
```

This project contains a series of [tasks](tasks.md) to complete. 
Each task has a corresponding unit test that you can run - it will initially fail, but will pass when you have successfully completed the task.
